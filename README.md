# DeePTB-NEGF

DeePTB-negf is a Python package that integrates the Deep Learning Tight-Binding (DeePTB) approach with the Non-Equilibrium Green's Function (NEGF) method, facilitating efficient quantum transport simulations with first-principles accuracy.

- **Overview**

Quantum transport simulations are crucial for understanding and designing nanoelectronic devices. Traditional methods often face a trade-off between computational efficiency and accuracy, limiting their practical applications. dptb-negf addresses this challenge by combining DeePTB's deep learning capabilities with the NEGF method, enabling high-throughput simulations without compromising on precision.
